Day 1:
Image Smoother:
             Brute force : temp 2D vector 
             then learn how to use only col vector and preval as temp variable
             then encoding teh value in matrix cell -> very important trick

Who is the Winner:
             brute force approach -> using queue or linked list
             using recursion -> teachesh how to apply mapping in the recursion -> you can prefer video link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46zD5d9y9b4

Circle and rectangle Overlap:
             simple run the for loop in each edge and check weather distance less than radious or not
             another apporach using the projection approach and nearest distance very good -> keep in mind
