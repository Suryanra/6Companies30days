<h4>Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements -> Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements ||</h4>
-> explanation: We have to increment n-1 elements by 1 to make them equal. This is equal to decrementing only 1 element by 1. Since we need to make all the elements equal we can consider he given problem to be equal to decrementing all the elements by 1 in each move until they are equal to the minimum element in the array.
